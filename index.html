        While I have been called by many names, ranging from the monster under the bed, to the boogie man, to utter egghead, I like to pride myself on my professional dexterity. I can be all of the above. At the moment however, I am simply the shadows in the corner of Subject 5354's eye. My assignment is to observe and record, discover and remember. I am forbidden from interfering, as only naturally occuring circumstances can qualify for the report. For further information, please peruse this site at your leisure. Should any human happen across it, may I point in the direction of the <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=April%20Fools">Urban Dictionary's definition of April Fools.</a>
