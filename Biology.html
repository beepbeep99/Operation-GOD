                <li><p1> Humans drink ethanol (in concentrations high enough to be used as an effective as a microbicide or a solvent) for the express purpose of achieving blood toxicity and disrupting normal brain function as a recreational activity </p1></li>
                         
                         
                         <li> <p1>Breeding does not kill them. A single human can mate dozens or hundreds of times in a lifetime. They often do so as recreation. Can confirm Xenobiology team six's belief they do not have a mating season </p1></li>
                         
                         <li><p1>Removing a limb will not fatally incapacitate humans: always destroy the head.</p1></li>
                         
                         <li><p1>During an adrenaline rush human muscles may stress themselves to the point of ripping from the bone and a human wouldn't notice </p1></li>
                         
                         <li><p1> Human bites can be fatally infectious to other humans, despite not being venomous </p1></li>
                         <li><p1>Human strength and speed is subpar, but they don’t need to overpower or outrun you. Humans only need to outlast you - and by other species’ standards, they don't tire easily </p1></li>

                           <li><p1>Subject is amenable to exercising her limb muscles, though neither impressively fast nor strong. "If I start running, you should start worrying" Subject values flexibility over muscle strength, cannot discern a tactical strategy behind human 'yoga' practice. Caution is advised, does not seem to need strength nor speed to subdue opponents
